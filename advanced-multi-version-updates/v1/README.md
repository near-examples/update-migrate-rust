# Guest Book Contract

The smart contract stores messages, keeping track of how much money was deposited when adding the message.

```rust
#[payable]
pub fn add_message(&mut self, text: String) {
  let payment = env::attached_deposit();
  let premium = payment >= POINT_ONE;
  let sender = env::predecessor_account_id();

  let message = PostedMessage {
    premium,
    sender,
    text,
  };
  self.messages.push(message);
  self.payments.push(payment);
}
```

# Quickstart

## 1. Build and Deploy the Contract

Install [`cargo-near`](https://github.com/near/cargo-near) and run:

```bash
# from repo root
cd advanced-multi-version-updates/v1
cargo near build --no-docker
```

Build and deploy:

```bash
# `update-migrate-rust-advanced-multiversion-updates.testnet` was used as example of <target-account-id>
cargo near deploy --no-docker <target-account-id> without-init-call network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
```

## 2. How to interact?

_In this example we will be using [NEAR CLI](https://github.com/near/near-cli)
to intract with the NEAR blockchain and the smart contract and [near-cli-rs](https://near.cli.rs)
which provides more control over interactions and has interactive menus for subcommands selection_

### 1. Add a Message

```bash
# NEAR CLI
near call <target-account-id> add_message '{"text": "a message"}' --amount 0.1 --accountId <account>
# near-cli-rs
near contract call-function as-transaction <target-account-id> add_message json-args '{"text": "a message"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0.1 NEAR' sign-as <account> network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
```

<br />

### 2. Retrieve the Stored Messages & Payments

`get_messages` and `get_payments` are read-only method (`view` method)

```bash
# NEAR CLI
near view <target-account-id> get_messages
# near-cli-rs
near contract call-function as-read-only <target-account-id> get_messages json-args {} network-config testnet now
# NEAR CLI
near view <target-account-id> get_payments
# near-cli-rs
near contract call-function as-read-only <target-account-id> get_payments json-args {} network-config testnet now
```

<br />

### 3. Continue in the V2 Folder

Navigate to the [v2](../v2/) folder to continue
